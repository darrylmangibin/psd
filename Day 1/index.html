                <p>I love to teach others how to live their best life NOW.</p>

                <p>My story goes like this:</p>

                <p>I have been doing the corporate dance for decades. I’ve consulted to C-suites at some of the world’s largest global players in energy, aerospace and defense, financial services, equipment leasing and senior housing.  I am blessed as I am currently a political appointee of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan where I am the leader of Public Affairs for the Maryland Insurance Commission, the state regulator of the $28 billion insurance industry. Being in a public service role is amazing and I am grateful for this opportunity.</p>

                <p>I have spent most of my career working with CEOs as a trusted advisor, often a coveted position.  The teams that I led were asked to execute strategic communications programs for these organizations. My blend of business, technology, and communications expertise has allowed me to quickly connect all of the dots and rapidly get tangible business results. I’ve been told that I was the secret ingredient that propelled organizations forward with their customers, employees, and shareholders. I’ve worked on some of the largest business transformation projects and loved being a change agent.</p>


                <p>In 2012 I embarked on a teaching career that has allowed me to instruct over 100 people (mostly women) in the field of marketing and communication. I have created online courses, in person courses, and workshops for McDaniel College and Notre Dame of Maryland University. I am so proud of my students and what they have achieved as writers and public speakers.</p>

                    <p>My biggest personal transformation occurred when I began to work with some of the world’s leading coaches – Angelique Rewers, David Neagle, Jenny Fenig, Gabby Bernstein, Renee Cerio and Gala Darling. I’ve learned so much from my teachers about self-love, forgiveness, mindset and marketing. I am now more comfortable being visible and sharing my voice with the world. I know that I am loved and I am safe. They taught me to take lots of little right actions. The Universe has rewarded me accordingly.</p>

                    <p>I also love to mentor people in my field and am so proud that many of my direct reports and students have gone on to positions of greater responsibility for Fortune 500 companies. Other students have started their own very successful PR agencies or seven figure freelance businesses. It’s very gratifying to be part of their journey.</p>

                    <p>In terms of education, I have a bachelor of arts degree in Communications / Systems Analysis from McDaniel College and a master of business administration with a concentration in Marketing and Management from the University of Baltimore.I also have a master of science degree in Business and Technology Management from Stevenson University.</p>

                    <p>I am also an Accredited Business Communicator and Accredited in Public Relations.  I am an active member of the International Association of Business Communicators and the Public Relations Society of America. I have also completed Gabby Bernstein’s Spirit Junkie Masterclass Level 1 Training.</p>
